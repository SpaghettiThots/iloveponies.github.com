## Description

We're giving a course on functional programming with [Clojure][clojure].

Clojure is a young [Lispish][lisp] programming language. It is a functional
programming language on the JVM platform. Because it runs on the JVM, all
Clojure programs can use the standard and third-party Java libraries freely.

You should have basic Java programming skills. No prior experience with
functional programming is required.

The course starts with an introduction to Clojure; its syntax and running it.
After the introduction, we'll concentrate specifically on writing whole
programs.

The course is one week long with a focus on workshop sessions. The course
material is in English.
